var lyrics = [
"And now, the end is near",
"And so I face the final curtain.",
"My friend, I'll say it clear",
"I'll state my case, of which I'm certain.",

"I've lived a life that's full.",
"I've traveled each and ev'ry highway;",
"And more, much more than this",
"I did it my way.",

"Regrets, I've had a few;",
"But then again, too few to mention.",
"I did what I had to do",
"And saw it through without exemption.",

"I planned each charted course;",
"Each careful step along the byway,",
"And more, much more than this,",
"I did it my way.",

"Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew",
"When I bit off more than I could chew.",
"But through it all, when there was doubt,",
"I ate it up and spit it out.",
"I faced it all and I stood tall;",
"And did it my way.",

"I've loved, I've laughed and cried.",
"I've had my fill; my share of losing.",
"And now, as tears subside,",
"I find it all so amusing.",

"To think I did all that;",
"And may I say - not in a shy way,",
"Oh no, oh no not me,",
"I did it my way.",

"For what is a man, what has he got?",
"If not himself, then he has naught.",
"To say the things he truly feels;",
"And not the words of one who kneels.",
"The record shows I took the blows -",
"And did it my way!",
"(wait haha)",
"Yes, it was my way."
